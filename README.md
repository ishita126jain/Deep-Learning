# Deep-Learning
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the brain, known as artificial neural networks. It involves training artificial neural networks on a large dataset, allowing the network to learn and make intelligent decisions on its own.

Deep learning models are used for a variety of tasks, including image classification, natural language processing, speech recognition, and game playing. They have achieved state-of-the-art results on many challenging problems and are widely used in industries such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce.

The training process of deep learning models involves the use of algorithms such as backpropagation and gradient descent to adjust the weights and biases of the network based on the errors it makes during prediction. The goal is to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output, resulting in a model that can accurately make predictions on new, unseen data.
